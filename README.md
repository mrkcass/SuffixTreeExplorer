Given a string, construct a suffix tree and display as graph and tree.

C# Forms implementation.

Suffix Tree Construction:

 Based on [code.google.com/p/csharsuffixtree](https://code.google.com/archive/p/csharsuffixtree).
 
 Implements [Ukkonen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm) linear time algorithm.
 
 Extends the original implementation by accepting stings of an arbitrary type using templates.
 
 
 Todo: 
  \tPopulate the tree view.
  \tImplement generalized construction.
