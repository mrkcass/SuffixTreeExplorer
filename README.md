-------------------------

###C# Forms implementation.

### Suffix Tree Construction:
* Based on [code.google.com/archive/p/csharsuffixtree](https://code.google.com/archive/p/csharsuffixtree).
* Implements [Ukkonen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm) linear time algorithm."
* Extends the original implementation by accepting stings of an arbitrary type using templates.

### Todo:
* Populate the tree view. 
* Implement generalized construction.
* Implement Burrows Wheeler Transform.
* Implement Suffix Array

### Why:
   I am looking for patterns and anomalies within program execution heap traces and snap shots.
